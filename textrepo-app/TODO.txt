! Fix support for both file and document metadata (rename MetadataDao -> FileMetadataDao and add DocMetadataDao?
  or fold everything that has to do with metadata into MetadataDao with appropriately named methods)

- Extract interfaces from Service classes.
- When uploading file, if fileDetail has no filename, throw exception instead of using "" as filename
- Scrutinize amount of parameters in constructors in Service classes. Indicates they do too many different things
- POST to "/documents?type=" is a query parameter. Perhaps multipart.field() or genuine FormDataBodyPart is better?
- In DocumentsResource: is @FormDataParam("contents") FormDataBodyPart bodyPart still needed?
- Must use 'upsert' pattern in File and Document "update metadata" endpoints. Now update only works on existing key
